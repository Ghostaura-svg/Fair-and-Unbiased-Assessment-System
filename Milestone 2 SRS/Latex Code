\section{General Description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
The Fair and Unbiased Assessment System (FUAS) addresses key concerns of both students and instructors. Students often perceive bias in grading, which can erode trust in instructors. Conversely, instructors may face unfounded accusations of favoritism. FUAS resolves this trust issue by providing unbiased, AI-assisted evaluation of quizzes and assignments. The system can process handwritten assessments uploaded by students, evaluate them based on provided answer keys and logical reasoning, and generate detailed reports highlighting errors.

The system will be available as both a mobile application and a web-based platform, each serving the same functional role.

\subsubsection{System Context}
The system interacts with three primary entities: students, instructors, and administrators. Each entity has its own interface and functionality according to their role.

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mobile Interface:} Includes all features of the web interface plus an option to capture and upload images directly using the device camera.
    \item \textbf{Web Interface:} Provides all functionalities except for the direct image capture feature available on mobile.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Computing Devices:} Smartphones, laptops, desktops, and tablets used to interact with the system.
    \item \textbf{Server / Web Host:} Requires sufficient processing capacity and memory to handle concurrent image uploads and assessment data.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mark Assist Engine:} An AI-based evaluation component that grades assessments and highlights mistakes based on logical and critical thinking.
    \item \textbf{Database System:} Stores uploaded images, extracted text, assessment metadata, and evaluation results securely.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Secure network protocols manage communication between mobile and web frontends and backend services.
    \item Standard web communication technologies support image uploads and retrieval of evaluation results.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Product Functions}
The primary functions of the system focus on what the system does rather than how it does it, which is detailed in the Functional Requirements section.

\subsubsection{Data Capture and Digitization}
The system accepts images of assessments in PDF or image formats. The AI tool extracts text from handwritten submissions for evaluation.

\subsubsection{Assessment Evaluation and Scoring}
The AI engine evaluates student responses against teacher-provided answer keys while considering critical thinking. Assessments are graded fairly and without bias.

\subsubsection{Reporting and Analytics}
The system automatically generates reports for students and instructors. Students view their own reports, while instructors access class-level analytics and summaries.

\subsubsection{Course Management}
Courses are assigned to instructors and students. The system supports different courses for different years and maintains appropriate course-instructor-student relationships.

\subsection{User Characteristics}
The system is designed specifically for educational use by students, instructors, and academic administrators, with functionality tailored to each role.

\subsubsection{Students}
Students upload images of assessments, receive reports with scores and feedback, and identify mistakes through the system-generated analysis.

\subsubsection{Teachers}
Teachers upload answer keys, and the system evaluates student submissions automatically. Reports show top, average, and lowest scores, as well as overall class performance.

\subsubsection{Academic Administrators}
Administrators manage course assignments, maintain student and instructor records, and assist users in case of credential loss or access issues.

\subsection{General Constraints}

\subsubsection{Regulatory and Policy Constraints}
All student assessment data must comply with institutional and educational data protection policies, including access control, auditing, and retention rules.

\subsubsection{Hardware Limitations}
The system relies on mobile devices for image capture and servers for processing. Low-resolution images may affect assessment evaluation accuracy.

\subsubsection{Interfaces to External Applications}
FUAS does not rely on external applications; the AI evaluation tool is integrated within the system.

\subsubsection{Parallel Operation Constraints}
Multiple users may interact with the system simultaneously, including peak usage periods during assessment submissions.

\subsubsection{Logging Constraints}
System activities must be recorded to ensure traceability, accountability, and dispute resolution.

\subsubsection{Control and Administration Constraints}
Administrative tasks such as user management, course creation, and assessment configuration require role-based access control to maintain system integrity.

\subsubsection{Safety and Security Considerations}
All academic data must be protected from unauthorized access, misuse, and loss using encryption, secure storage, and controlled access.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}

\subsubsection{Handwriting Legibility Assumption}
Student handwriting and image quality must meet a minimum standard for the AI tool to accurately process and evaluate assessments. Guidelines are provided to ensure proper image capture and legibility.

\subsubsection{External AI System Dependency}
The AI evaluation engine must be available and operational to process and evaluate assessments. Without it, the automated assessment functionality will be unavailable.
