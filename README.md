# Fair and Unbiased Assessment System

## Overview
The **Fair and Unbiased Assessment System** is a web-based application designed to assist university instructors in evaluating quizzes, assignments, and other assessments using Artificial Intelligence. The system ensures fair, accurate, and consistent grading while reducing human errors and bias in the evaluation process.

Faculty members can upload student submissions, which are automatically evaluated by the AI engine using model answers or predefined rules. Instructors can review, verify, and edit AI-generated results to maintain transparency and academic integrity.
