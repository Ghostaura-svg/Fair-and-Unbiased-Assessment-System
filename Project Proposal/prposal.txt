\section{Stakeholder Identification}

There are many stakeholders involved in the \textbf{Fair and Unbiased Assessment System}. They are connected through different roles with this system, but every person has an important role to make the software successful.

\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|p{7cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Stakeholder} & \textbf{Role} & \textbf{Relation to the System} \\
\hline
University Instructors & Primary users of the software; they review assessments made by AI and provide feedback. & Use the system for every assessment to check student work quickly; feedback improves grading accuracy. \\
\hline
Students & Receive feedback and marks fairly. & Assignments and quizzes are checked by the software without bias or mistakes. \\
\hline
System Administrator & Maintain and manage technical operations of the system. & Manage user accounts, secure data, update the system, and fix technical issues. \\
\hline
